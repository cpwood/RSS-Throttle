# RSS Throttle
RSS Throttle is a .NET Core 3.1 Nuget package that allows you to control the timing and scope of an RSS or Atom feed. You can use it to:

* delay new content so it's not delivered until a day and time that suits you;
* limit the number of new items you receive;
* filter content by category - either narrowing the content to categories you care about, or removing the content in categories you don't care about; or
* only deliver content that was published in a specific window of time.

You can use this library to create your own RSS throttling service in an [Azure Function](https://github.com/cpwood/RSS-Throttle/tree/main/src/AzureFunction) in just a few minutes and for very little money!
