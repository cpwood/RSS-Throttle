<ul><li><strong>Adrian Lam reacts to Wigan&#8217;s defeat to Catalans Dragons</strong>.</li><li><strong>Lam: &#8220;Better opposition punish you, like they did today.&#8221;</strong></li><li><strong>FT | Catalans Dragons 48-0 Wigan Warriors</strong>.</li></ul>



<h3>Adrian Lam pointed to the continual mistakes made by his side being the key to their away defeat to Catalans Dragons on Saturday.</h3>



<p>Wigan&#8217;s unbeaten run of seven games in the league came to a halt at the hands of the French side, as Steve McNamara&#8217;s men put on eight unanswered tries at Stade Gilbert Brutus.</p>



<p>Speaking to the media shortly after the final whistle, Lamgave his immediate reaction to the result. </p>



<p>&#8220;I thought Catalans were very good, they completed high and exectued their game plan.</p>



<p> &#8220;I thought we were really poor, from the start were were never really in the game at all.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2021-05-29-at-16.36.24-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-5123" srcset="https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2021-05-29-at-16.36.24-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2021-05-29-at-16.36.24-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2021-05-29-at-16.36.24-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2021-05-29-at-16.36.24-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2021-05-29-at-16.36.24.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Tommy Leuluai returned to the side after overcoming a sternum injury.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The head coach highlighted how mistakes from Wigan were their undoing.</p>



<p>&#8220;We had opportunities early but again our mistakes came, and better opposition punish you, like they did today.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everything we did went against us. We make errors early and from that point we never got better.&#8221;</p>



<p>The game ended in disapointing circumstances as Zak Hardaker was handed a red card following a coming-together with his opposing full back Sam Tomkins. Catalans&#8217; Joel Tomkins was then handed a yellow card for his follow up in the ugly scenes that followed.</p>



<p>On the moment, Lam said: &#8220;I need to have another look at it. However, being red-carded in the last minute for that is unacceptable.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m not sure how bad it is, but it was a really poor end to the game.&#8221;</p>



<p>Wigan are next in action on Friday 11th June, as they travel away to face Huddersfield Giants.</p>



<p>With almost two weeks between Saturday&#8217;s defeat and the Warriors&#8217; next outing, Lam said there are positives and negatives to the break. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a challenge now for the group to respond in two weeks time.</p>



<p>&#8220;it gives those players with niggling injuries time to get over them, but equally we&#8217;d like to be back out there next weekend if we could and put things right.&#8221;</p>

<ul><li><strong>Match report as Wigan Warriors lose to Catalans Dragons.</strong></li><li><strong>Wigan&#8217;s winning start to the 2021 Super League season came to an end away in France.</strong></li><li><strong>FT | Catalans Dragons 48-0 Wigan Warriors.</strong></li></ul>



<h3>Wigan&#8217;s unbeaten start to the 2021 Betfred Super League season came to an end at the hands of Catalans Dragons in Perpignan on Saturday evening. </h3>



<p>Eight unanswered tries for the French side saw Steve McNamara&#8217;s side win 48-0 in front of a limited crowd. </p>



<p>The home side got the scoreboard ticking over early, when ex-Wiganer Michael McIlorum crossed for the French side in the sixth minute.</p>



<p>Catalans struck again in the 18<sup>th</sup> minute, and again the score came from an ex-Wigan player. A grubber from Josh Drinkwater found the run of Sam Tomkins to touch down.</p>



<p>The full back grabbed a second on the stroke of half time, diving over in the corner, taking the scores to 16-0 after Maloney missed the following conversion attempt.</p>



<p>Steve McNamara’s men extended their lead shortly after half time, when Maloney converted a penalty given for a high tackle on Arthur Mourgue.</p>



<p>Mourgue turned scorer in the 52<sup>nd</sup>, stepping inside his marker and crossing for his first Super League try.</p>



<p>Drinkwater grabbed a score in the 55<sup>th</sup>, chasing his own grubber on the last to touch down.</p>



<p>The half back got his second of the game just three minutes later, dummying a pass out left and ducking inside to Warriors markers to score.</p>



<p>Mike McMckeen added a seventh for the home side in the 62<sup>nd</sup>, assisted by winger Tom Davies.</p>



<p>Mathieu Laguerre rounded off the win for Catalans, going over in the corner with five minutes left on the clock.</p>



<p>The game ended in a disappointing fashion, as a coming together saw Zak Hardaker given a red card for leading with his head on Sam Tomkins, while Joel Tomkins&#8217; retaliation saw him served with a yellow. </p>

<h3><strong>Wigan Warriors can confirm that centre Oliver&nbsp;Gildart&nbsp;will leave the Club at the end of the 2021 season to join Wests Tigers</strong>.</h3>



<p>A product of the Wigan Academy,&nbsp;Gildart, 24, has been a first team regular since 2016 – making 129 appearances and scoring 61 tries for his hometown Club.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Great Britain and England international is a double Super League winner with Wigan and was also part of the World Club Challenge triumph in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wigan Warriors executive director, Kris Radlinski, said: &#8220;Oliver has made it clear for a number of years that he has an NRL ambition. He has honoured his contact and has served the Club and the town tremendously well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Young&nbsp;players come to us at 14 years of age and you watch them transition into men. The development journey takes you through many highs and lows and there is always a sense of pride when they achieve their goals.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oliver should be very proud&nbsp;of what he has achieved at Wigan and in Super League. We wish him well in the next stages of his career and life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gildart&nbsp;said: &#8220;I’ve been living my childhood dream playing for my hometown club since the age of 11.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ll never forget my debut try against Warrington and of course, it doesn’t get much better than playing in front of a packed Old Trafford and scoring a try in a Grand Final win.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve had the privilege of being surrounded by legends year in year out at this Club who have helped me become the person l am today.</p>



<p>&#8220;However, it’s been no secret that I’ve wanted to challenge myself over in Australia. When Michael Maguire and his team showed interest, it became clear that Wests Tigers is where I want to be in the next stage of my career.</p>



<p>&#8220;I owe a lot of credit to my dad, Bill Ashurst and Alan Rimmer for pushing me on in my amateur days at Wigan St Pats.</p>



<p>&#8220;And a massive thanks to the fans. You have been outstanding through thick and thin. We can’t wait to have you back in the stands.</p>



<p>&#8220;With that said, there is unfinished business to take care of for Wigan this season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;My priority is to get back to playing my best rugby in Cherry and White and finish the season off with another Grand Final ring in front of the fans.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Wigan Warriors can confirm that prop forward Ben Kilner has left the Club by mutual consent.</h3>



<p>Kilner said: “I have decided to leave Rugby League and pursue a different career. The sport has been a massive factor in my life for the past 15 years and has made me into the man I am today.</p>



<p>“However, through injury and other difficulties I have not been able to achieve the things I wanted to.</p>



<p>“Because of that I knew I had to put my physical and mental health first and pursue a different goal.”</p>



<p>Despite progressing through Wigan’s Academy system and becoming a double Academy Grand Final winner, Kilner was restricted to game time during his Academy career because of numerous injuries, including two shoulder reconstructions.</p>



<p>The 22-year-old, who made one appearance for the Wigan first team, added: “I want to thank everyone at Wigan Warriors &#8211; both staff and players for everything they have given me and for all of their support.”</p>



<p>Wigan Warriors executive director, Kris Radlinski, said: “We are incredibly proud and supportive of the decision that Ben has made. He has developed into an outstanding young man and he will always be welcome back at Wigan.”</p>



<p>Wigan Warriors would like to wish Ben all the best for the future and in the next stage of his life.</p>

<ul><li><strong>New Loch Lomond Whiskies Legends interview series launches with Sean O’Loughlin as the first guest.</strong></li><li><strong>Kris Radlinski to sit down with a number of Club legends as part of the new content series.</strong></li><li><strong>Watch Part One, Part Two and Part Three of the interview with O’Loughlin</strong>&nbsp;<strong>below.</strong></li></ul>



<h3>Wigan Warriors are delighted to launch a new interview series – Loch Lomond Whiskies Legends – as Sean O’Loughlin sits down with Kris Radlinski to discuss his career at his hometown Club.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In the #SpritOfTheWarriors, the series will see executive director Radlinski chat with a number of Club legends to discuss their time at Wigan Warriors.</p>



<p>Our first interview is with former Club captain, Sean O’Loughlin.&nbsp;Watch Part One, Part Two and Part Three below.</p>



<p>In Part One of the interview, O’Loughlin reflects on the 2020 Super League Grand Final, managing the process of retirement, his relationship with Tommy Leuluai and Liam Farrell, what it’s like to be in illustrious company with the great captains gone by and the role of leadership. Radlinski and O’Loughlin also try an 18-year-old bottle of Loch Lomond whisky!</p>

  "cache_st": 1621934606,
  "entry_id": "1_rxatvfd4"
});
</script>



<p></p>



<p>In Part Two, the conversation turns to coaching as O’Loughlin reflects on the past four months in his first stint as an assistant coach. He talks about the intensity of being a coach compared to a player and the mental fatigue that comes with it, still being able to have interaction with players by running messages on the pitch on game day and what his coaching philosophy could look like in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>O’Loughlin also discusses how he is using personal strengths of past coaches in his own coaching methods, adapting to an ever-changing workplace in modern day society, as well as his long-term coaching ambitions and learning the trade of a coach at Wigan.&nbsp;</p>

  "cache_st": 1621934559,
  "entry_id": "1_35a2nfo4"
});
</script>



<p></p>



<p>Part Three sees O&#8217;Loughlin reflect on his 19-year career with his hometown club. He talks about how he feels his game and the sport changed over the years, as well as the role of the No.13 position. After playing 459 games and ten major trophies for Wigan, O&#8217;Loughlin describes how his body is feeling now, the relief of winning the 2010 Super League Grand Final and of having no regret of playing in the NRL. He also looks back at his career highlights and memorable moments. </p>



<p>The conversation then moves to the sport in general and O&#8217;Loughlin&#8217;s hopes of there being more hunger from fans to watch Rugby League post-Covid-19. He also explains about what the sport can do to sell itself more and to have more eyes watching it, as well as stating England&#8217;s chances of winning the 2021 World Cup under his former coach Shaun Wane. </p>

<h3>Here’s everything you need to know ahead of Wigan’s Betfred Super League clash with Catalans Dragons.</h3>



<p>Adrian Lam’s men head to the South of France on Saturday where they&#8217;ll meet Steve McNamara&#8217;s side at the Stade Gildert Brutus in Perpignan.</p>



<p>Wigan will hope to replicate the win away in 2020, when tries from Sam Powell, Oliver Gildart, Bevan French and a double for Joe Burgess helped them to a 12-28 victory over the Dragons.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/12-Sept-20-Catalans-v-Wigan-9-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1714" srcset="https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/12-Sept-20-Catalans-v-Wigan-9-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/12-Sept-20-Catalans-v-Wigan-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/12-Sept-20-Catalans-v-Wigan-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/12-Sept-20-Catalans-v-Wigan-9.jpg 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Oliver Gildart going over for a score in Wigan&#8217;s 2020 away victory over Catalans Dragons. </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Campaign so far</h3>



<p>The Cherry and Whites remain unbeaten in the Betfred Super League so far, having won seven from seven. Catalans have also had a strong start to 2021, having won six of their opening seven. </p>



<p>The Dragons toppled reigning champions St Helens last week at Stade Gilbert Brutus to end their winning start to the season. </p>

<h3>Team news</h3>



<p>Speaking earlier this week Adrian Lam outlined full back Bevan French&#8217;s condition after suffering a hamstring injury against Salford last weekend. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are not totally clear just yet. He is awaiting results on a scan and is seeing a surgeon. It doesn’t look good and he won’t be playing this week certainly.”</p>



<p>After being handed a Grade F charge (Unacceptable language based on national or ethnic origin), prop forward Tony Clubb will serve the fourth of an eight match ban. Full statement&nbsp;<a href="https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/2021/05/05/wigan-warriors-disciplinary-outcome-tony-clubb/">HERE</a>.</p>



<h3>Injury news</h3>



<p>Oliver Gildart misses out as he continues to overcome a groin injury which has kept the centre out of action in 2021.</p>



<p>Liam Marshall is still unavailable as he recovers from a knee injury (ACL) which has kept the winger out of action since September 2020</p>



<p>Half back Jai Field continues his recovery from a torn hamstring sustained during Wigan’s season opener against Leigh Centurions in March.</p>



<h3 id="block-b8feec58-bd15-4500-a443-e76bc4c783c9">Wigan Warriors 21-man squad to face Catalans Dragons</h3>



<p>On Thursday Adrian Lam named an unchanged 21 to face Catalans on Saturday. Only one change to the side that faced Salford last weekend, with Tommy Leuluai returning to replace the injured Bevan French.</p>

<h3>The Opposition</h3>



<p>On Thursday Steve McNamara named his 21-man squad to take on Wigan on Saturday. After pulling up during the warm up against St Helens last Saturday, both Sam Tomkins and Samisoni Langi are included in this weekend&#8217;s squad.</p>

<h3>Coach quotes</h3>



<p>Speaking to the media in his weekly press conference ahead of Saturday&#8217;s game, Lam discussed the challenge of facing Catalans.</p>



<p>&#8220;They have been outstanding. While they have recruited good players, they also have a number of ex-Wigan players that know how we play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;As a team they look well connected. They are a big side, they believe in what they’re doing and if you turn up and make errors against them, it’ll be a long night for you.</p>



<p>&#8220;We’ve made errors the last few weeks, so it’s important we improve on that this week to give ourselves a chance. If we can do that, hopefully we can get a result.&#8221;</p>

<ul><li><strong>Dom Manfredi previews Wigan’s trip across the Channel to face Catalans Dragons.</strong></li><li><strong>Manfredi: “We’re going to have to be at our best to get a result.”</strong></li><li><strong>Catalans Dragons v Wigan Warriors, Saturday 29th May, Stade Gilbert Brutus, 5pm K.O. (UK time).</strong></li></ul>



<h3>Dom Manfredi feels only their best will be enough for Wigan to get a result from their game away at Catalans on Saturday.</h3>



<p>It’s third versus first in the Betfred Super League clash in France this weekend as Adrian Lam&#8217;s men look to extend their winning run to eight games. </p>



<p>Speaking to the media earlier this week via Zoom, the winger recognised the magnitude of the challenge that the game presents.</p>



<p>Manfredi said: “They’ve got a great team out there. We’re going to have to be at our best this week to go out there.</p>



<p>“It’s a tough gig travelling and all that sort of stuff, so we’re going to have to be at our best to get a result.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="684" src="https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f01a5b53-e3d9-4e9b-828f-b899beeb99bd-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5070" srcset="https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f01a5b53-e3d9-4e9b-828f-b899beeb99bd-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f01a5b53-e3d9-4e9b-828f-b899beeb99bd-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f01a5b53-e3d9-4e9b-828f-b899beeb99bd-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f01a5b53-e3d9-4e9b-828f-b899beeb99bd-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f01a5b53-e3d9-4e9b-828f-b899beeb99bd.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Stade Gilbert Brutus will host the Round 8 tie on Saturday.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite having injury woes throughout the squad, the Warriors have had their best ever start to a Super League season, which Manfredi believes demonstrates the fight within the side.</p>



<p>“It’s a good sign of the character in the team we’ve got here at the minute. We’re all sticking together and all playing for each other and that’s where we’re coming up with the points.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of teams that would be struggling in this position, but I think we’ve grinded those wins out and all stuck together and fought for each other.”</p>

<p>The 27-year-old admitted it’s impacted on the quality of their game but the most important factor is getting points on the board.</p>



<p>“At this point of the year it’s all about getting those wins. We’re not playing our best rugby at the minute and I’m sure that’s to come.</p>



<p>“We’re getting the wins and they’re putting us in a good position for the rest of the season.”</p>

<h3>Get the latest on the Wigan Warriors squad ahead of Saturday&#8217;s away trip to face Catalans Dragons with the Assured Screening Injury Update. </h3>



<p>Adrian Lam&#8217;s side will head to Perpignan to take on the Dragons in a 6pm kick-off (5pm UK time) in what will see first take on third in the Betfred Super League.</p>



<h3>Team news</h3>



<p>Tommy Leuluai returns to the 21 this week after overcoming a sternum injury which has kept the half back out of action since Wigan’s win over Leeds on 15th April. The Club captain replaces injured full back Bevan French.</p>



<p>Speaking earlier this week, Lam gave an update on the condition of French, after the full back suffered a hamstring injury last weekend against Salford.</p>



<p>“We are not totally clear just yet. He is awaiting results on a scan and is seeing a surgeon. It doesn’t look good and he won’t be playing this week certainly.”</p>



<p>After being handed a Grade F charge (Unacceptable language based on national or ethnic origin), prop forward Tony Clubb will serve the fourth of an eight match ban. Full statement&nbsp;<a href="https://wiganwarriors.com/blog/2021/05/05/wigan-warriors-disciplinary-outcome-tony-clubb/">HERE</a>.</p>



<h3>Injury news</h3>



<p>Oliver Gildart misses out as he continues to overcome a groin injury which has kept the centre out of action in 2021.</p>



<p>Liam Marshall is still unavailable as he recovers from a knee injury (ACL) sustained last September against Castleford Tigers.</p>



<p>Half back Jai Field continues his recovery from a torn hamstring sustained during Wigan’s season opener against Leigh Centurions in March.</p>



<h3>21-man squad to face Catalans Dragons</h3>
